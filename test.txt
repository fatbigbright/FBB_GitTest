Second commit

To delete commits with errors from remote repo:
1. "git pull" to get the latest source.
2. "git branch old_master" to create backup of the master branch.
3. "git push origin old_master:old_master" to backup current master branch.
4. "git reset --hard 75c96" to reset to a previous commit.
5. Go to Github and go to "Admin" to switch default branch to one that is not "master".
6. "git push origin :master" to delete remote master branch.
7. "git push origin master" to create new master branch according to local repo.
8. Over.
